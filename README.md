# Data
All real and processed datasets involved in the paper can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11261241). Please download all the `.rar` files and decompress them. Place the decompressed folders and the `.csv` file in the data directory.

# Tutorial

- **Check and Install Required R Packages**: Before running the tutorial, it is recommended to check and install all the required R packages. Please see `requirements.txt` for the list of dependencies.

- **Run the Tutorial**: After preparing the R environment, researchers can follow the tutorial for data integration and BBTD reproducibility. Refer to `Tutorial.Rmd` for detailed instructions. Since running the processed data can be time-consuming, we recommend directly applying BBTD method based on the processed data which is saved in the `readydata` directory.
